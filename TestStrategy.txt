Testing Progressive Web Apps
Some of the challenges of PWAs are:
 - Offline Mode
    Example strategy: we can simulate Offline Mode by using browser developer tools or automation frameworks that allow us to simulate these conditions or use network mocking.
 - Notifications and Background Synchronisation
    Tool like Playwright can be used to check if service workers are correctly installed and are functioning as expected.
 - Testing Across Web & Mobile
    For mobile-specific behaviors use emulation features of Playwright.
 - Performance (PWAs aim to provide fast and reliable experience)
    Perform load testing and performance audits (audits can be made using e.g. Google Lighthouse)
